# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
This repository contains project files for Computer Vision, Nanodegree via Udacity. It combine knowledge of Computer Vision Techniques and Deep learning Architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications (facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition).

# Project Structure
The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks:

models.py
Notebook 1 : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

Notebook 2 : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

Notebook 3 : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN

Notebook 4 : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
